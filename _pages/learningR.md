Here's some favourite resources for learning R:

[**R Cookbook**](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/), great for all things ggplot - the only resource that was around when I started learning R (seven years ago) and I still use regularly


[**Programming with R**](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/), a recent discovery that provides a structured intro to data analysis in R for beginners




Advanced R topics:

[**Intro to purrr** by Jenny Bryan](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/). I started using purrr recently and it's very useful for batching stuff. Love that this tutorial shows a user workflow


[**Advanced R programming** by Hadley Wickham](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/), more in-depth intro to purrr
