**News**: I'm teaching two courses on R with [**GradProSkills**](https://www.concordia.ca/students/gradproskills.html) at Concordia University.
[**Reproducible Scientific Analysis with R**](https://www.concordia.ca/students/gradproskills/workshops/details.html?subject_area=GPDI&catalog_number=517)
[**Beginnerâ€™s Guide to the R Programming Language**](https://www.concordia.ca/students/gradproskills/workshops/details.html?subject_area=GPDI&catalog_number=515)

Here's some more resources for learning R I've found useful:

[**R Cookbook**](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/), great for all things ggplot - the only resource that was around when I started learning R (seven years ago) and I still use regularly


[**Programming with R**](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/), provides a structured intro to data analysis in R for beginners - also very useful for creating an R course!




Advanced R topics:

[**Intro to purrr** by Jenny Bryan](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/). I started using purrr recently and it's very useful for batching stuff. Love that this tutorial shows a user workflow with troubleshooting etc.


[**Advanced R programming** by Hadley Wickham](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/), more in-depth intro to purrr
