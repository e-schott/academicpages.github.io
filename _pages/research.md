Cognates in Bilingual Word Learning: Is it easier for bilingual infants to learn banana/banane than apple/pomme?
-----
Bilinguals learn two labels for the things in their environment. Sometimes, these labels sound similar across the two languages, e.g., banana and *banane* ("banana" in French), but often the labels sound different, e.g. apple and *pomme* ("apple" in French). Is it easier for bilingual infants to learn word pairs that sound similar across languages? I am testing this question using eye-tracking during word recognition tasks, as well as parental report of infants' vocabulary development.

Fine-Tuning Language Discrimination: Do infants keep track of which language is spoken?
-----
Bilingual infants often are raised who are bilingual themselves, who are mixing their languages when speaking to their child ("Do you want a *pomme*?"). I am interested in whether bilingual infants can detect when a single word is borrowed from another language, and whether infants can associate a speaker with the language being spoken.

Improving Research Methods for Studying Hard-to-Recruit Populations: How can we use infant participants in an efficient way?
-----
Completing a study focusing on hard-to-recruit populations such as bilingual infants can take months to years. One strategy to avoid testing precious participants in a study doomed for the file drawer is to run statistical tests during data collection to decide whether to continue collecting data ("data peeking"). When done without correction, data peeking can increase Type I error (false positives). Fortunately, there are easy-to-apply statistical corrections that enable us to use data peeking in a controlled, transparent way.
