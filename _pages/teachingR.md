 I have taught multiple courses on R with [**GradProSkills**](https://www.concordia.ca/students/gradproskills.html) as well as the [**Center for Research on Human Development**](http://crdh.concordia.ca/homee.html) at Concordia University.

[Slides for **"Beginner's Guide to R for Psychology Researchers"** ](https://osf.io/2bfjy/)

[**Beginnerâ€™s Guide to the R Programming Language**](https://www.concordia.ca/students/gradproskills/workshops/details.html?subject_area=GPDI&catalog_number=515)

[**Reproducible Scientific Analysis with R**](https://www.concordia.ca/students/gradproskills/workshops/details.html?subject_area=GPDI&catalog_number=517)


More resources for learning R I've found useful:

[**R Cookbook**](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/), great for all things ggplot - a gem of a resource that was around when I started learning R (seven years ago) and I still use regularly

[**Learning Statistics with R**](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/) by Danielle Navarro, a great intro to novice programmers, specifically written for psych students!

[**Programming with R**](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/), provides a structured intro to data analysis in R for beginners - also very useful for creating an R course!
