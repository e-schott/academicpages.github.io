I am a PhD Student in Krista Byers-Heinlein's lab at Concordia University. I'm interested in how babies learn language, and in particular what bilingual infants know about their language environment. I am also interested in how we can improve our research methods, especially when working with hard-to-recruit populations like bilingual infants.
