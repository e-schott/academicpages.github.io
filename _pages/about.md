I am a PhD Candidate with [Krista Byers-Heinlein](http://infantresearch.ca/team/) at Concordia University. I'm interested in how babies learn language, and in particular what bilingual infants know about their language environment. I am also working on improving research practices, especially when working with hard-to-recruit populations like bilingual infants.
